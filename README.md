# Hate Speech Detector LS 2023: Neural Networks
This is my repository for LearnerSpace 2023 project for Neural Networks.

The course consisted of 4 weeks of learnings and assignments with a Final Project at the end. The final project was to fine-tune a pre-trained model for a specific downstream task, and create a simple demo app to interact with it.

I have created a Hate Speech Detector using pretrained BERT model with the help of Transformers library. I have used hate_speech_18 dataset from Hugging Face. The interactive interface is built using Gradio to deploy the model. Model takes input as any text and outputs whether the text is hate speech or not. Model was trained for 4 epochs on CPU, and achieved the accuracy of 87%.
